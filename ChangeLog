	* WIMLIB version 0.6.2
	* extract_resource_to_staging_dir():  Fixed infinite loop and a couple
	other issues
	* util.c:  Added full_write() function to handle the case where write()
	succeeds but returns a short count (which is supposed to be allowed.)
	* read_xml_data(): Move call to xmlCleanupParser() to end, so that
	libxml releases all allocated memory after writing the XML data.
	* sha1.c, sha1.h:  Functions local to sha1.c now declared static in
	sha1.c instead of extern in sha1.h.  Also adjusted indentation.
	* sha1.c, sha1.h, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:  Allow using SHA1
	functions from libcrypto, part of OpenSSL.  Enabled by default if
	detected. Note: The OpenSSL code is a little faster.
	* sha1-ssse3.asm, sha1.c, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:  Allow using
	SSSE3-accelerated SHA1 block update code from Intel.  Give
	--enable-ssse3-sha1 to configure to enable this.  This is currently even
	faster than the OpenSSL code but doesn't work on all CPUs.
	* create_staging_file(): Return -1 and set errno when out of memory.
	* dentry_to_stbuf(): Fill in st_blocks field.
	* Various files:  Minor fixes in comments.

	* WIMLIB version 0.6.1
	* write_xml_data():  Write byte order mark (0xfffe) before XML data.
	Microsoft's imagex.exe cannot open a WIM without this marker, even
	though Windows PE can boot from it.  Perhaps Microsoft's WIM driver
	doesn't check the XML data, but imagex.exe does.
	* finish_write(), wimlib_add_image(), wimlib_set_boot_idx():  Make the
	boot metadata entry in the WIM header point to the metadata for the
	bootable image (if there is one) rather than the first image.
	* calculate_dentry_statistics(): Do not count the root directory as a
	directory for the purposes of the <DIRCOUNT> XML element.
	* write_metadata_resource():  Calculate SHA1 message digest of
	uncompressed metadata resource to use as the hash value.
	* wimlib_internal.h, wimlib.h, various other files: Some documentation
	and coding style fixes

4-14-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	* WIMLIB version 0.6.0
	* Many files: Most functions now return an 'int' error code instead of a boolean.  
	* Many files: xmalloc() and xstrdup() have been gotten rid of, so that
	the library can cleanly return an error code if memory is exhausted.  In
	addition, wimlib can use a custom malloc() and free() by passing them to
	wimlib_set_memory_allocator().
	* Many files: Some functions now take an int `flags' parameter as a bitwise OR of
	flags defined in wimlib.h, rather than one or more boolean parameters.
	* Many files: Removed code dealing with security data and streams- wimlib didn't
	actually anything with them anyway, and there are no plans to support
	them.
	* Many files: Moved some stuff from wimlib_internal.h to dentry.h, lookup_table.h,
	and xml.h
	* wim.c, wimlib.h: New wimlib_has_integrity_table() function in public API.
	* xml.c, wim.c: Stricter checking to make sure every image has a name.
	* wim.c, dentry.c: Fixed some memory leaks.
	* extract.c: Fixed symlinks for extracting images.
	* wimlib.h: Fixed and updated the documentation.

4-8-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	* WIMLIB version 0.5.0
	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Doxyfile, wimlib.h:  There is now documentation
	for wimlib's API.  Every public function in wimlib.h is documented with
	a Doxygen comment.  The documentation is not yet built or installed
	automatically. Build it manually by running `doxygen' in the `doc'
	directory.
	* xpress-comp.c: Fixed "error" in XPRESS compression (M$'s software
	expects magic symbol at end of compressed data).
	* lz.c: Improved the performance of the LZX and XPRESS compressors, and
	the size of the compressed output, by using a hash table to help find
	matches, and by doing lazy evaluation of matches to find better matches,
	like in zlib.  See lz.c.
	* configure.ac, mount.c: It is now possible to pass `--without-fuse' to
	the configuration script to build wimlib without libfuse, making the
	wimlib_mount() and wimlib_unmount() functions unavailable.
	* various files:  More functions now return failure if passed invalid
	parameters rather than aborting with an assertion failure.
	* wim.c:  A few functions such as wimlib_begin_read() are now internal
	rather than part of the public API, in order to simplify the public API
	slightly.
	* configure.ac, m4/iconv.m4:  The configure script now checks for the
	presence of the iconv() function rather than assuming it is available in
	libc.
	* configure.ac: Compression verification added to the configure script
	and enabled by default (at least for now).  Use
	`--disable-verify-compression' to disable this.
	* README:  Added "PORTABILITY" section.
	* resource.c: Removed unused get_wim_resource() and
	extract_full_resource_to_fd() functions.
	* mount.c: Testing with glibc 2.15 on x86 produced a weird error where
	mq_getattr() returned a Function Not Implemented error.  To make
	mounting still have a chance at working, the code now sets the message
	queue size to 8192 if mq_getattr() doesn't work.

3-31-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	* WIMLIB version 0.4.8
	* xpress-comp.c, xpress-decomp.c, xpress.h: Support for XPRESS
	compression and decompression
	* mkwinpeimg: Renamed `mkwinpeiso' to `mkwinpeimg', and made it support
	making a bootable disk image or plain WIM file as well as a bootable
	ISO.
	* lzx-decomp.c, lzx-comp.c, huffman.c, decomp.c, comp.c, comp.h,
	decomp.h: Factored some code out of lzx-decomp.c and lzx-comp.c into
	huffman.c, decomp.c, comp.c, comp.h and decomp.h.
	* mount.c: Increased timeout on imagex unmount to 600 seconds (need a
	better solution for this!!)
	* doc/imagex-*.1: Updated the documentation in various places

3-29-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	* WIMLIB version 0.4.7
	* mount.c: Fixed bug that prevented read-write mounts from successfully
	    committing after existing files in the WIM were modified
	* mount.c: Increased timeout on imagex unmount to 30 seconds

3-29-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	* WIMLIB version 0.4.6
	* lzx-decomp.c: Fixed bug made LZX decompression not work on 32 bit
	systems

3-25-2012	Eric Biggers	<ebiggers3@gmail.com>
	versions 0.4 through 0.4.5
	Rewrote the library.
	- wimlib now uses GNU autoconf and builds a real shared library.
	- Removed the `wiminfo', `wimxmlinfo', `updatewim', and
	  `wimextract' programs in favor of the `imagex' program
	- Support for multi-image WIMs
	- Support for the XML data using libxml2
	- Support for integrity table
	- Included SHA1 code from GNU coreutils
	- Much more error checking.
	- Library is more reusable
	- Lookup table is now a hash table rather than a sorted array.
	- Got rid of the wide to ascii and ascii to wide functions; really what
	  we want is functions that convert UTF-8 to UTF-16, and vice versa.
	  This was fairly easy to do using the POSIX-specified iconv() function.
	- Rewrote lzx.c and moved it to lzx-decomp.c
	- Added lzx-comp.c for LZX compression

12-31-2012	Carl Thijssen
	version 0.2
	Wrote the original library.
