However, as of version 1.7.0, the following exception applies to wimlib itself
--- that is, the shared library or DLL file:  If you do not use the libntfs-3g
support in wimlib --- that is, your application never uses the flags
WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_NTFS or WIMLIB_ADD_FLAG_NTFS, or wimlib is not linked to
libntfs-3g at all, such as is the case for the Windows builds distributed on
sourceforge.net --- you are also granted the rights of the GNU LGPL (Lesser
General Public License), version 3.  See COPYING.LGPLv3 for the full text of
this additional license.
