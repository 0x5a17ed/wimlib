.TH IMAGEX "1" "March 2013" "@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ @VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-info \- Display information about a WIM file, or change information about
an image

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR [\fIIMAGE_NUM\fR | \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR]  \
[\fINEW_NAME\fR] [\fINEW_DESC\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR]...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR displays information about \fIWIMFILE\fR, and optionally
changes which image is bootable, or what the name and description of an image
are.

If neither an image nor any flags other than \fB--check\fR are specified, some
basic information about the WIM archive as well as information about the images
contained in it will be printed.  If an image is specified (as a 1-based image
index or an image name), the printed information is restricted to that
concerning the specified image.

Changes to the WIM are made if \fINEW_NAME\fR and/or \fB--boot\fR are specified.
\fINEW_NAME\fR is taken to be the new name of the image specified by
\fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR, while \fINEW_DESC\fR is taken to be its new
description.  If \fINEW_DESC\fR is not specified, the image's description is
unchanged.

\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR does not support modifying a split WIM, although you may
display information about one.

.SH NOTES

The possible modifications to \fIWIMFILE\fR by \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR are made
quickly without re-building the entire WIM.  \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR will only take a
significant amount of time to complete if \fB--check\fR is specified when the
WIM previously had no integrity table.

Aborting an \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR command that modifies \fIWIMFILE\fR is unlikely to
result in corruption of \fIWIMFILE\fR.  Even if \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR is aborted
while the integrity table is being calculated (with \fB--check\fR), the WIM
should be in a consistent state with any changes to the bootable index,
name, or description of the specified image committed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--boot\fR
Indicates that the specified image is to be made the bootable image of the WIM
archive.
.TP
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally if an action that requires modifying the WIM archive is
specified, include an integrity table in the modified WIM.  If this option is
not specified and \fIWIMFILE\fR is modified, no integrity table is included in
the modified WIM, even if there was one before.
.TP
\fB--extract-xml\fR \fIFILE\fR
Extracts the raw data from the XML resource in the WIM file to \fIFILE\fR.
Note: the XML data will be encoded using UTF-16LE, and it will begin with a
byte-order mark.
.TP
\fB--header\fR
Shows detailed information from the WIM header.
.TP
\fB--lookup-table\fR
Prints all the entries in the stream lookup table of the WIM.
.TP
\fB--metadata\fR
Prints the metadata, including the security data and the directory entry tree
but not the XML data, for the specified image.  If no image is specified, the
metadata for all images is printed.  This only works on standalone WIMs or on
the first part of a split WIM.
.TP
\fB--xml\fR
Prints the raw XML data from the WIM.  Note: the XML data will be encoded using
UTF-16LE, and it will begin with a byte-order mark.
