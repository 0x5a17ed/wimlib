.TH IMAGEX "1" "October 2012" "imagex (wimlib) wimlib @VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
imagex-info \- Display information about a WIM file, or change information about
an image

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex info\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR [\fIIMAGE_NUM\fR | \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR]  \
[\fINEW_NAME\fR] [\fINEW_DESC\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR]...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBimagex info\fR displays information about \fIWIMFILE\fR, and optionally
changes which image is bootable, or what the name and description of an image
are.

If neither an image nor any other flags other than \fB--check\fR are specified,
some basic information about the WIM archive as well as information about the
images contained in it will be printed.  If an image is specified, the printed
information is restricted to that concerning the specified image.

Changes to the WIM are made if \fINEW_NAME\fR and/or \fB--boot\fR are specified.
\fINEW_NAME\fR is taken to be the new name of the image specified by
\fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR, while \fINEW_DESC\fR is taken to be its new
description. \fINEW_DESC\fR defaults to the old description if it is not given.

Since none of these changes require changing the WIM's file resources, metadata
resources, or stream lookup table, they can be done very quickly by only
re-writing the header and XML data.  It will only take significant time if
\fB--check\fR is specified for a WIM that had no integrity checks before.

\fBimagex info\fR does not support modifying a split WIM, although you may
display information about one.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--boot\fR
Indicates that the specified image is to be made the bootable image of the WIM
archive.
.TP
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally if an action that requires changing the WIM archive is
specified, include an integrity table in the modified WIM.  If this option is
not specified and \fIWIMFILE\fR is recreated, no integrity table is included in
the modified WIM, even if there was one before.
.TP
\fB--extract-xml\fR \fIFILE\fR
Extracts the raw data from the XML resource in the WIM file to \fIFILE\fR.
Note: the XML data should be encoded using UTF-16LE, and it should begin with a
byte-order mark.
.TP
\fB--header\fR
Shows detailed information from the WIM header.
.TP
\fB--lookup-table\fR
Prints all the entries in the stream lookup table of the WIM.
.TP
\fB--metadata\fR
Prints the metadata, including the security data and the directory entry tree,
for the specified image.  This only works on standalone WIMs or on the first
part of a split WIM.
.TP
\fB--xml\fR
Prints the XML data for the WIM.
