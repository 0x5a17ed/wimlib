.TH IMAGEX "1" "June 2013" "@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ @VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-extract \- Extract files or directories from a WIM image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR \fIIMAGE\fR [\fIPATH\fR...]  [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR extracts one or more files or directory trees
from the specified \fIIMAGE\fR contained in the Windows Imaging (WIM) file
\fIWIMFILE\fR.
.PP
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR is intended for extracting only a subset of a
WIM image.  If you want to extract or "apply" a full WIM image to a directory or
NTFS volume, use \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR (1) instead.
.PP
\fIIMAGE\fR specifies the image in \fIWIMFILE\fR that contains the files or
directory trees to extract.  It may be a 1-based index of an image in the WIM or
the name of an image in the WIM.  Use the \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ info\fR (1)
command to show what images a WIM file contains.
.PP
Each \fIPATH\fR specifies a file or directory tree within the WIM image to
extract.  See \fBPATH_SPECIFICATIONS\fR.
.PP
By default, files and directories are extracted to the current directory.  Use
\fB--dest-dir\fR to choose an alternate target directory.  Alternatively, use
\fB--to-stdout\fR to extract a file to standard output to pipe into another
program.
.PP
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR supports extracting files and directory trees
from stand-alone WIMs as well as split WIMs.  See \fBSPLIT WIMS\fR.
.SH PATH SPECIFICATIONS
Each \fIPATH\fR specifies a file or directory tree within the WIM image to
extract.  Each path must be specified as an absolute path starting from the root
of the WIM image, like those output by the \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ dir\fR (1)
command.  However, path separators may be either forward or backward slashes,
and the leading slash is optional; also, on Windows, the paths are treated
case-insensitively, while on UNIX, paths are treated case-sensitively.
.PP
If no \fIPATH\fRs are provided, the default behavior is to extract the full
image, as if the path "/" had been provided.
.SH SPLIT WIMS
You may use \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR to extract files or directory trees
from a split WIM.  This uses the \fB--refs\fR="\fIGLOB\fR" option in the same
way as in other commands such as \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR.  See
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR (1) for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if an integrity table is
present.
.TP
\fB--ref\fR="\fIGLOB\fR"
File glob of additional split WIM parts that are part of the split WIM.  See
\fBSPLIT_WIMS\fR.
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Print the path of each file or directory within the WIM image as it is
extracted.
.TP
\fB--unix-data\fR
See the documentation for this option in \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-apply\fR (1).
.TP
\fB--no-acls\fR
See the documentation for this option in \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-apply\fR (1).
.TP
\fB--strict-acls\fR
See the documentation for this option in \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-apply\fR (1).
.TP
\fB--include-invalid-names\fR
See the documentation for this option in \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-apply\fR (1).
.TP
\fB--to-stdout\fR
Extract the files to standard output instead of to the filesystem.  This can
only be provided if all the specified \fIPATH\fRs are to regular files (not
directories or reparse points).  If present, alternate data streams are not
extracted.
.TP
\fB--dest-dir\fR=\fIDIR\fR
Extract the files and directories to the directory \fIDIR\fR instead of to the
current working directory.
.SH NOTES
See the documentation \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR (1) for documentation about
what data and metadata are extracted on UNIX versus on Windows.
.PP
On UNIX, one can alternatively mount the WIM image with \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@
mount\fR and then extract the desired files or directories using any standard
command-line or graphical program.
.PP
Reparse-point fixups (a.k.a. changing absolute symbolic links and junctions to
point within the extraction location) are never done by \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@
extract\fR.  Use \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR if you want this behavior.
.PP
Unlike \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ apply\fR, \fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ extract\fR does not
support extracting files directly to a NTFS volume using libntfs-3g.

.PP
Extract the "sources" directory from the first image in "boot.wim" to the
current directory:
