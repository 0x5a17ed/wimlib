.SH NAME
imagex-join \- Join split WIMs into a standalone one-part WIM

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex join\fR [\fIOPTION...] \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR \fISPLIT_WIM...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Joins the \fISPLIT_WIMs\fR into a standalone one-part WIM \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR.

All parts of the split WIM  must be specified.  You probably want to do so using
a shell wildcard.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading each \fISPLIT_WIM\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when writing \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR,
write an integrity table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity table
is included in the new WIM file, even if there was one before.

.SH EXAMPLES
Join a split WIM, with the parts named `windows*.swm' where the * is anything
(usually the number of the part, except for the first part which may have no
number), and write the joined WIM to the file `windows.wim'.
