.TH IMAGEX "1" "November 2012" "imagex (wimlib) wimlib @VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
imagex-join \- Join split WIMs into a standalone one-part WIM

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex join\fR [\fIOPTION...] \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR \fISPLIT_WIM...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Joins the \fISPLIT_WIMs\fR into a standalone one-part WIM \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR.

All parts of the split WIM  must be specified.  You probably want to do so using
a shell wildcard.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading each \fISPLIT_WIM\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when writing \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR,
write an integrity table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity table
is included in the new WIM file, even if there was one before.

.SH EXAMPLES
Join a split WIM, with the parts named `windows*.swm' where the * is anything
(usually the number of the part, except for the first part which may have no
number), and write the joined WIM to the file `windows.wim'.
.RS
.PP
imagex join windows.wim windows*.swm
.RE

.SH NOTES
You can also use \fBimagex export\fR to export all images from a split WIM.
This would be nearly the same as \fBimagex join\fR, although some information in
the XML data could be discarded.

Perhaps for this reason, Microsoft's implementation of imagex does not provide a
\fB/join\fR option.
