.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Joins the \fISPLIT_WIMs\fR into a standalone one-part WIM \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR.

All parts of the split WIM  must be specified.  You probably want to do so using
a shell wildcard.


.SH OPTIONS

\fB--check\fR
When reading each \fISPLIT_WIM\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when writing \fIOUT_WIMFILE\fR,
write an integrity table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity table
is included in the new WIM file, even if there was one before.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP 
imagex join windows.wim windows*.swm
.LP
Join a split WIM, with the parts named `windows*.swm' where the * is anything
(usually the number of the part, except for the first part which may have no
number), and write the joined with to the file `windows.wim'.
