.SH NAME
imagex export \- Exports an image from a WIM archive to an existing or new WIM archive

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex export\fR \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR (\fISRC_IMAGE_NUM\fR | \
\fISRC_IMAGE_NAME\fR | all ) \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR [\fIDEST_IMAGE_NAME\fR\] \
[\fIDEST_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

Copies the specified image in \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR to \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR,
optionally changing its name and/or description and/or compression type.
If \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR exists, it is taken be be a WIM archive to which the image
will be appended.  Otherwise, it is created as a new WIM archive containing only
the exported image.

The source image may be specified by \fISRC_IMAGE_NUM\fR, which must be an integer that is
an index of an image in \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR, starting at 1.  Alternatively, it may be
the name of an image in \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR, or it may be the keyword "all" to
specify that all images are to be exported.

If given, \fIDEST_IMAGE_NAME\fR specifies the name to give the image being
exported to \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR.  The default is its name in \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR.
\fIDEST_IMAGE_NAME\fR cannot be specified if multiple images are being exported.

If given, \fIDEST_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION\fR specifies the description to give the
image being exported to \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR.  The default is its description in
\fISRC_WIMFILE\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--boot\fR
Specifies that the exported image is to be the bootable image of the WIM archive.

If multiple images are being exported, this flag indicates that the image in the
\fISRC_WIMFILE\fR that is currently marked as bootable is to be made bootable in
\fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR.  If no image in \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR is bootable, it is an
error.
.TP
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fISRC_WIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when writing \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR with the new image added,
write an integrity table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity table
is included in \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR, even if there was one before.
.TP
\fB--compress\fR[=\fITYPE\fR]
Specifies the compression type for \fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR.  This is only valid if
\fIDEST_WIMFILE\fR does not yet exist.

\fITYPE\fR may be "none",
"maximum", or "fast".  By default, the compression type is "none".  If \fB--compress\fR
is specified but \fITYPE\fR is not, the compression type is taken to be
"maximum", which is LZX compression.  "fast" compression is XPRESS compression.

.SH NOTES

\fBimagex export\fR does not support split WIMs.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP 
image export boot.wim 2 image2.wim --compress=maximum
.LP 
Export the second image of 'boot.wim' to the new WIM file 'image2.wim', and
change the compression type to maximum, if it wasn't maximum already.
