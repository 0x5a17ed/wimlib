.SH NAME
imagex mountrw \- Mount an image from a WIM archive read-write

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex mountrw\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR (\fIIMAGE_NUM\fR | \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR)  \
\fIDIRECTORY\fR [--check] [--stream-interface=\fIINTERFACE\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBimagex mountrw\fR mounts the image specified by \fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or
\fIIMAGE_NAME\fR on the directory \fIDIRECTORY\fR using FUSE (Filesystem in
UserSpace).  It is mounted read-write.  

It is permissible to omit the \fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR only if
\fIWIMFILE\fR contains only one image.

A temporary directory is created to stage files.  Whenever a new file is created
in the mounted filesystem, it is created in the staging directory.  Also,
whenever a file in the WIM file itself is modified, it is copied to the
staging directory.  When the WIM is unmounted with the \fBimagex unmount
--commit\fR command, file resources are collected from the original WIM as well
as the staging directory to create the new WIM file.  When the new WIM file is
completely written, the old WIM file is overwritten with it.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present. 
.TP
\fB--stream-interface\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
Specify the interface to alternate data streams (ADS) in the WIM that will be
provided by the mounted filesystem.  These are a NTFS feature that found their
way into the WIM file format.

If "none", it will be impossible to read or write the ADS.

If "xattr" (default), the ADS will be accessible through extended attributes.
Each ADS will be an extended attribute named "user.*", where the * is the name
of the ADS.  See \fBsetfattr\fR (1) and \fBgetfattr\fR (1).

If "windows", the ADS will be accessible by specifing the filename, then a
colon, then the name of the ADS; for example, "myfile:mystream".
