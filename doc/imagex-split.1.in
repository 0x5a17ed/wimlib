.SH NAME
@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@-split \- Split a WIM into multiple parts

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ split\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR \fISPLIT_WIMFILE\fR \fIPART_SIZE\fR [\fIOPTION...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

Splits \fIWIMFILE\fR into parts with size at most \fIPART_SIZE\fR mebibytes,
with the first part having the name \fISPLIT_WIMFILE\fR and the other parts
having names numbered in order of the parts.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when writing each \fISPLIT_WIMFILE\fR, write an integrity
table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity tables are included in the
split WIM files, even if there was one in the original WIM.

.SH EXAMPLES
Splits the WIM 'windows.wim' into 'windows.swm', 'windows2.swm', 'windows3.swm',
etc. where each part is at most 100 MiB:
.RS
.PP
@IMAGEX_PROGNAME@ split windows.wim windows.swm 100
.RE

.SH LIMITATIONS

It it possible for the size of the parts to exceed the \fIPART_SIZE\fR given.
This is impossible to avoid and Microsoft's program has this problem as well
because the WIM file format provides no way to divide a single file resource in
the WIM among multiple split WIM parts.  So if you, for example, have a file
inside the WIM that is 100 MiB, then an uncompressed split WIM will have at
least one part that is 100 MiB in size to contain that file.  However, if the
WIM resources are compressed then less space would be needed.
