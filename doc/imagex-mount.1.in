\fIDIRECTORY\fR [--check] [--stream-interface=\fIINTERFACE\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimagex mount\fR mounts the image specified by \fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or
\fIIMAGE_NAME\fR on the directory \fIDIRECTORY\fR using FUSE (Filesystem in
UserSpace).  It is mounted read-only.

It is permissible to omit the \fIIMAGE_NUM\fR or \fIIMAGE_NAME\fR only if
\fIWIMFILE\fR contains only one image.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present. 
.TP
\fB--stream-interface\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
Specify the interface to alternate data streams (ADS) in the WIM that will be
provided by the mounted filesystem.  These are a NTFS feature that found their
way into the WIM file format.

If "none", it will be impossible to read or write the ADS.

If "xattr" (default), the ADS will be accessible through extended attributes.
Each ADS will be an extended attribute named "user.*", where the * is the name
of the ADS.  See \fBsetfattr\fR (1) and \fBgetfattr\fR (1).

If "windows", the ADS will be accessible by specifing the filename, then a
colon, then the name of the ADS; for example, "myfile:mystream".
