.SH NAME
imagex-optimize \- Optimize a WIM archive

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex optimize\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR [--check]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimagex optimize\fR will rebuild the stand-alone WIM \fIWIMFILE\fR.  The new
WIM is written to a temporary file, and it is renamed to the original file when
it's ready.  This action will remove any holes that have been left as a result
of appending images, so the new WIM may be slightly smaller than the old WIM.
In addition, some errors in the original WIM may be fixed by re-writing it
(although most cannot).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; include an integrity table in the optimized WIM.  If this option is not
specified and \fIWIMFILE\fR, no integrity table is included in the optimized
WIM, even if there was one before.

.SH NOTES

\fBimagex optimize\fR does not support split WIMs.
