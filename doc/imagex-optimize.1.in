.SH NAME
imagex-optimize \- Optimize a WIM archive

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex optimize\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR [--check] [--recompress]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimagex optimize\fR will rebuild the stand-alone WIM \fIWIMFILE\fR.  The new
WIM is written to a temporary file, and it is renamed to the original file when
it's ready.  This action will remove any holes that have been left as a result
of appending images, so the new WIM may be slightly smaller than the old WIM.
In addition, some errors in the original WIM may be fixed by re-writing it
(although most cannot).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; in addition, include an integrity table in the optimized WIM.  If this
option is not specified, no integrity table is included in the optimized WIM,
even if there was one in the original WIM.
.TP 6
\fB--recompress\fR
Recompress all compressed streams in \fIWIMFILE\fR when rebuilding it.  This
will increase the time needed to rebuild the WIM, unless the WIM is
uncompressed, but it may result in a better compression ratio if wimlib can do a
better job than the program that wrote the original file.  A side effect of this
is that every stream in the original WIM will be checksummed, so this can help
verify that the WIM is intact (equivalent to applying all the images from it).

Note: as mentioned in the README, wimlib generally provides a slightly better
XPRESS compression ratio than Microsoft's software, while it generally provides
a slightly worse LZX compression ratio than Microsoft's software.  So, you may
not want to specify \fB--recompress\fR when optimizing a LZX-compressed WIM
created on Windows.

.SH NOTES

\fBimagex optimize\fR does not support split WIMs.

\fBimagex optimize\fR is roughly equivalent to:
.RS
.PP
\fBimagex export\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR all tmp.wim [--check] && mv tmp.wim \fIWIMFILE\fR
.RE
.PP
