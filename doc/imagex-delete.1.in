.SH NAME
imagex delete \- Delete an image from a WIM archive

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimagex delete\fR \fIWIMFILE\fR \fIIMAGE\fR [--check]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBimagex delete\fR deletes the specified image from the Windows Imaging (WIM)
file \fIWIMFILE\fR.

\fIIMAGE\fR specifies the WIM image to deleted.  It may be a 1-based index of an
image in the WIM, the name of an image in the WIM, or the keyword "all" to
indicate that all images are to be deleted.  Use the \fBimagex info\fR (1)
command to show what images a WIM file contains.

.SH NOTES

The WIM file is rebuilt with all unnecessary file data removed.  This is
different from Microsoft's imagex.exe, which only will delete the directory tree
metadata and XML data for this operation.

Also, unlike imagex.exe, it is legal to delete all the images from a WIM and
have a WIM with 0 images, although such a file wouldn't be very useful.

\fBimagex delete\fR does not support split WIMs.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
\fB--check\fR
When reading \fIWIMFILE\fR, verify its integrity if the integrity table is
present; additionally, when rewriting \fIWIMFILE\fR after the specified image was
deleted, write an integrity table.  If this option is not specified, no integrity
table is included in the new WIM file, even if there was one before.

.SH EXAMPLES
Delete the first image from 'boot.wim':
.RS
.PP
image delete boot.wim 1
