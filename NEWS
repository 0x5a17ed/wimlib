Only the most important changes more recent than version 0.6 are noted here.

Version 1.0.2:
	Fixed bug when capturing NTFS file with multiple named data streams

Version 1.0.1:
	Fixed problem when exporting images from XPRESS to LZX compressed WIM or
	vice versa

Version 1.0.0:
	Enough changes to call it version 1.0.0!

	Capturing a WIM directly from a NTFS volume, and applying a WIM directly
	to a NTFS volume, is now supported.

	Hard links and symbolic links have much improved support.  They are
	supported for WIM capture, WIM application, and mounted WIMs (you can
	even make them on read-write mounted WIMs).

	Alternate data streams are now supported on mounted WIMs through an
	xattr or a Windows-style stream interface.  Also they are supported when
	capturing a WIM from NTFS or applying a WIM to NTFS.

	Split WIMs are better supported.  You may now apply an image directly
	from a split WIM, mount an image from a split WIM read-only, or export
	an image from a split WIM.

	Using a capture configuration file is now supported (but not fully yet).

	SHA1 message digests are checked in more places, so we can make sure
	applied and captured data is correct.

	Man pages have been updated and consolidated.

Version 0.7.2:
	Fixed segfault when unmounting read-only WIM.

Version 0.7.1:
	Support for joining and splitting WIMs.
	Also, security data is now preserved by default.

Version 0.6.3:
	Can now build with older gcc and system headers, like on CentOS 5.

Version 0.6.2:
	Fixed bug that made it impossible to overwrite files in read-write
	mount.

Version 0.6.1:
	Write byte-order mark before WIM XML data.  (imagex.exe requires this to
	be there.)
