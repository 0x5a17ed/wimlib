Only the most important changes more recent than version 0.6 are noted here.

Version 1.1.1:
	Appending images to a WIM is now be done by default without re-building
	the whole WIM.  Use the --rebuild flag to get the old behavior (which
	was to re-build the entire WIM when a new image is appended).

	A new command `imagex optimize' is now available to manually re-build a
	WIM that has wasted space due to repeated appends.

	Previously, the soname of libwim.so has been 0.0.0, despite many
	interface changes.  The soname is now updated to 1.0.0 and will now be
	updated each release.

	A possible bug with changing the bootable image of a WIM was fixed.

Version 1.1.0:
	Resources will now be compressed using multiple threads by default.
	(This applies to `imagex capture', `imagex append', and `imagex
	export').

	Some performance improvements in mounted WIMs.

	More progress information is shown when capturing a WIM.

Version 1.0.4:
	Lots of minor fixes, code cleanups, and some documentation updates.
	Nothing in particular is really noteworthy.

Version 1.0.3:
	LZX and XPRESS compression improvements.

	Fixed calculation of Directory Count, File Count, Total Bytes, and Hard
	Link Bytes of the WIM.

Version 1.0.2:
	Fixed bug when capturing NTFS file with multiple named data streams.

	Internally, we are now using inode structures, even though these don't
	appear literally in the WIM file.  This simplifies some of the code
	(mainly for WIM mounting) and likely fixed a few problems, although it
	needs more testing.

Version 1.0.1:
	Fixed problem when exporting images from XPRESS to LZX compressed WIM or
	vice versa

Version 1.0.0:
	Enough changes to call it version 1.0.0!

	Capturing a WIM directly from a NTFS volume, and applying a WIM directly
	to a NTFS volume, is now supported.

	Hard links and symbolic links have much improved support.  They are
	supported for WIM capture, WIM application, and mounted WIMs (you can
	even make them on read-write mounted WIMs).

	Alternate data streams are now supported on mounted WIMs through an
	xattr or a Windows-style stream interface.  Also they are supported when
	capturing a WIM from NTFS or applying a WIM to NTFS.

	Split WIMs are better supported.  You may now apply an image directly
	from a split WIM, mount an image from a split WIM read-only, or export
	an image from a split WIM.

	Using a capture configuration file is now supported (but not fully yet).

	SHA1 message digests are checked in more places, so we can make sure
	applied and captured data is correct.

	Man pages have been updated and consolidated.

Version 0.7.2:
	Fixed segfault when unmounting read-only WIM.

Version 0.7.1:
	Support for joining and splitting WIMs.
	Also, security data is now preserved by default.

Version 0.6.3:
	Can now build with older gcc and system headers, like on CentOS 5.

Version 0.6.2:
	Fixed bug that made it impossible to overwrite files in read-write
	mount.

Version 0.6.1:
	Write byte-order mark before WIM XML data.  (imagex.exe requires this to
	be there.)
